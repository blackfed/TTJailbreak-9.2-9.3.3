TUTORIAL:

-On your iOS device open safari and go <a href="http://tinyurl.com/jxk64fj">HERE</a> and click install when it asks you to install an app with a Chinese name.
-Then, go to Preferences>General>Device Configuration>Click on the certificate and autorize it
-Go to your HomeScreen, click on the newly instaled app and accept for notifications when asked
-After that click on the colored circle, lock your devide and wait for some minutes on your lockscreen until your device reboot itself
-When your device boot up you will see Cydia on your HomeScreen, open it and check if it works

REMEMBER:

For now this is a semi-untethered Jailbreak, so everytime you reboot your device, in order to make cydia, his extensions and your tweaks to work you have to open the PP app, and re-do everything that you've done before
(note that this will take less time than before)
